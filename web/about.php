	<h4>From the developer:</h4>
	<p>Running UW Reggie is a hobby of mine, and a way to give a bit back to the UW community. I use it myself every quarter and am interested in making it as helpful as possible.</p>
	<p>If you love Reggie and want to tell me so, drop me an email at <em><a href="mailto:uwreggie@gmail.com">uwreggie@gmail.com</a></em>. Same thing goes if you have suggestions, an idea for a new feature or found a bug that you'd like me to look into.</p>
	<p><b>Reggie is for you.</b> Let me know what you think, and help me make it even better.</p>
